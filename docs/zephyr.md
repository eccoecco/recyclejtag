# Recycle JTAG: Zephyr RTOS

Zephyr RTOS is a modern RTOS, that deals with a lot of the low level drivers and initialisation necessary to bring a board up.

## Setting Up

Rather than the vanilla Zephyr distribution, I use Nordic's variant because it integrates nicely with the [nRF Connect Extension for VSCode](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nRF-Connect-for-VS-Code) extension.

Using their nRF Connect Toolchain Manager means that they download Zephyr and relevant toolchains, and it usually just works (or gets really close).
